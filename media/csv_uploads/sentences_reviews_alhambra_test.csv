1;I tour of Sth Spain i was on 3 weeks ago included a stop in Granada but was a waste of the day as it was taken up by a  3.5 hr tour of Alhambra Palace.   Out local tour guide was lovely but the group stopped listening after 30 minutes as we were guided to room after room of fake facades.   This was made worse by having to produce our passports “withing the palace parks” 4 times at different checkpoints.  The guide told us it was to keep the scammers from buying up the tickets and then on selling them, (as if) which we could have swallowed if the booth operators had bothered to even once look at our entry ticket, but all they wanted to do was to scan our passports.Tip: skip this and go to Malaga instead.

I was able to park at the first car park as I had got there so early, you pay by a machine near the car park on the way out. After the beautiful palace it naturally lead me into the gardens. I would compare this place to the Alcázar at Seville, they are very similar in style but both equally fabulous non the less. I then had to queue a little while to get into the Alcazaba - wonderful views from the top. I spent about 4 hours in all. Did around 10,000 steps so bring your trainers.

24;Your head will spin in trying to figure out and plan a visit unless you pay for a guided tour that picks you up from a Granada hotel. I was staying in Malaga and wanted to just get tickets to the site itself. The official website gives you information but inaccurate tips. Such as they tell you that you may spend hours in line getting ticket at the window but this is only during peak tourist season during the summer and warmer months! My visit was on Jan 16. When I got there at 8:00am there were 8 people in line for tickets and were selling them all day with no more that 20-30 people. I think they want to promote the tour guide businesses which is probably ok. The other difficulty I found was that there are no buses leaving Malaga early enough to get there by 8:30am when the Alhambra opens. You can only buy and use the tickets for either the morning or the afternoon. They are strict about enforcing this. Since there were no buses I rented a car and left Malaga at 6:00am and got there at a little before 8. Parking was right close to the site and cost me 7 Euro from 8 til noon. By the way Malaga had 65F degree weather but when I got to Granada it was 32F during the whole morning! Bring warm clothes this time of year. I'm told that in the summer hits 90F and up! So if you're staying local in Granada, it'll be easier to go get tickets at the window. Otherwise, buy a guided tour and plan well!

26;"I am sad to admit that my wife and I encountered arbitrary behavior from the staff at the Alhambra. We bought tickets online in advance and showed up at the main entrance to this architectural complex exactly at the appointed time. The territory of the Alhambra is large, so when we showed the tickets to the controllers at the entrance, we specifically asked them if there was any order for visiting the sights. They answered that there was no such order: the main thing is to enter the territory of the Alhambra at the specified time, and then you can stay there until the evening. We walked from park to park, from palace to palace, and finally reached the so-called Nasrid Palace. And there we were stopped by an employee who said that we were two hours late, so he refused to let us in. I explained that exactly two hours ago we had passed through ticket control, we were on the Alhambra grounds in time, and then we walked around its vast grounds. I asked to speak to the senior manager to resolve this issue, but the staff laughed and said that the senior manager ""is now with his family in his big house."" Honestly, I'm not joking. I received exactly this - arrogant and vile - answer. I asked, what about money? I paid for entry and if I am not allowed in, I would like to get money for the service not rendered. The staff laughed again and said that I can complain anywhere. I did write several complaints - to Spanish and Catalan authorities - but I received no response. The issue, of course, is not about money: firstly, the amount is not that big, and secondly, my wife and I did visit the Nasrid Palace - the day before the described conflict - during the so-called night excursion (oh yes, this is such a plot twist in my story=)).

We bought tickets online in advance and showed up at the main entrance to this architectural complex exactly at the appointed time. The territory of the Alhambra is large, so when we showed the tickets to the controllers at the entrance, we specifically asked them if there was any order for visiting the sights. They answered that there was no such order: the main thing is to enter the territory of the Alhambra at the specified time, and then you can stay there until the evening. We walked from park to park, from palace to palace, and finally reached the so-called Nasrid Palace.

28;Alhambra consists of several fantastic sites which you really should review separately (Nasrid Palace, Generalife and the Alcazaba). But here are some hints to how to make the visit more smooth and easy. First – buy your ticket early and by early I mean months ahead. This is if you use the online booking system. A better way (if you plan to stay more than one day in Grandad) is to buy the Granada Card (online) which has more tickets available even if the main online booking site is sold out. You’ll will even with the Granada Card get a time slot for your visit to The Nasrid Palace which is the only site within Alhambra that you’ll need a time slot for. The before/after lunch timeslots for the visit is no more even if it might still be written in the different homepages about Alhambra. A good route with less people is to start as early as possible by entering through Porta Justicia (bus line C3 stops right outside) and then beginning with the Nasrid Palace. The go towards the palace gardens along the “tower tour” to the Generalife and then go through the old living quarters before you reach the Nasrid Palace again and then end by going to the fortress (Alcazaba). This route is supported by the excellent auidoguide you can get. Very modern with a smartphone thingy which you can look at movies, pictures and of course get the stories. Each point in the audioguide is around 1 min long which makes the guide interesting all through. Besides that you have to touch the screen every now and then – you’ll get an earpiece so it’s almost handsfree as well. You’ll need a guide in some way, audio, live or book since almost nothing is signposted. There are limited places to eat in the area and the signed “cafes” are vending machines.;Alhambra consists of several fantastic sites which you really should review separately (Nasrid Palace, Generalife and the Alcazaba).;Alhambra consists of several fantastic sites which you really should review separately (Nasrid Palace, Generalife and the Alcazaba).####[['sites', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic']];Alhambra consists of several fantastic sites which you really should review separately (Nasrid Palace, Generalife and the Alcazaba).####[['Alhambra', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Nasrid Palace', 'attraction experience', 'neutral', 'review separately'], ['Generalife', 'attraction experience', 'neutral', 'review separately'], ['Alcazaba', 'attraction experience', 'neutral', 'review separately']];Alhambra consists of several fantastic sites which you really should review separately (Nasrid Palace, Generalife and the Alcazaba).####[['Alhambra', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic sites'], ['Nasrid Palace', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Generalife', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['Alcazaba', 'attraction experience', 'positive', 'fantastic']];204

43;PLEASE READ THIS!I am a well seasoned traveller and have travelled all over the world.  I purchased an all inclusive Alhambra ticket for my family of 5 well ahead of time on the internet and booked an 8.30 entrance slot.  We arrived at 8am and duly collected our tickets.  There were very few people entering the park and we spent a very enjoyable hour in the Alcazaba before having a coffee to take in the views and the beautiful weather.  We then went to see the Nazari palace.  As the guard checked our tickets he pointed out that we had a timed entry of 8.30 and refused us entry.  He was quite unpleasant and told us to try our luck back at the main ticket office (15 minutes walk back to the entrance).  We were distraught and raced back to the entrance wondering how we could have been so stupid.  We had no luck there despite pleading with the ticket office that we had made a genuine mistake.With hindsight, I can see that I missed two lines of text towards the bottom of my two page confirmation email explaining that entry to the Nazari palaces is by timed ticket only.  Likewise, two TINY lines of text on the back of the entrance ticket.  Also very small signs in English on the general sign posts around the palaces.  Unless you have properly read all your literature, you may not, like us, appreciate that the general Alhambra entrance ticket actually means that you have free access into all parts of the palaces during the opening hours printed on your ticket, but that the entrance time you specify when selecting your ticket online is ONLY FOR THE NAZARI PALACE AND IF YOU MISS YOUR TIMED SLOT YOU WILL BE DENIED ENTRY OUTRIGHT.This was a deeply disappointing, not to mention upsetting, experience for our whole family.  I had planned ahead, booked our tickets and was thoroughly looking forward to our visit.  Revisiting is not an option as tickets are sold out for the rest of the duration of our stay.  Staff were surly, rude and downright unpleasant.

43;PLEASE READ THIS!I am a well seasoned traveller and have travelled all over the world.  I purchased an all inclusive Alhambra ticket for my family of 5 well ahead of time on the internet and booked an 8.30 entrance slot.  We arrived at 8am and duly collected our tickets.  There were very few people entering the park and we spent a very enjoyable hour in the Alcazaba before having a coffee to take in the views and the beautiful weather.  We then went to see the Nazari palace.  As the guard checked our tickets he pointed out that we had a timed entry of 8.30 and refused us entry.  He was quite unpleasant and told us to try our luck back at the main ticket office (15 minutes walk back to the entrance).  We were distraught and raced back to the entrance wondering how we could have been so stupid.  We had no luck there despite pleading with the ticket office that we had made a genuine mistake.With hindsight, I can see that I missed two lines of text towards the bottom of my two page confirmation email explaining that entry to the Nazari palaces is by timed ticket only.

48;Don’t pay huge money for the historic tour: it’s basically a scam: I paid nearly 200 euros each for a so-called three hours Alhambra historical tour.

65;To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions. We booked our tickets some weeks in advance, printed out the tickets as instructed, brought our ID and had no problems with entry. We arrived at the entry gate, asked a helper what to do and they kindly directed us to the palace, which is about 20-30 minutes walk from the main entrance. If you do things right it will work out alright!We recommend an early ticket, our ticket was for 10AM and we arrived at 0845 and spent some time leisurely walking to the palace entrance. An early ticket also means you can do the rest of the Alhambra at your leisure without worrying about getting back for your time slot. For the price, we paid 14 Euros per person, we spent the whole day at the Alhambra leaving at 1800, having lunch in the cafeteria adjacent to the hotel Parador restaurant. We made the waiters day as we had some local cuisine and can really recommend the food. It was excellent and made a good point to stop during the early afternoon to recharge the batteries.As for the Alhambra itself we can only add to the already excellent reviews by saying how wonderful it was. The Nasrid Palace was stunning and the monuments in the rest of the grounds were equally impressive. Given the 14 Euro entry fee for all this and spending the entire day there it is easy to see why this should be considered such great value for money.We did notice various groups and small parties doing guided tours and while we can't comment on the quality or value for money of these we opted for the audio guides, which were 6 Euros each. So, all in all the visit cost 20 Euros per person which we think is excellent value for money. Doing it this way means you can do things at your leisure as well rather than being rushed round by the guide.;To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions.;To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions.####[['entry to the palace', 'management', 'negative', 'disappointment']];To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions.####[['entry to the palace', 'management', 'positive', 'avoid disappointment'], ['NULL', 'management', 'positive', 'book well in advance and follow the instructions']];To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions.####[['entry', 'management', 'positive', 'avoid disappointment'], ['booking', 'management', 'positive', 'book well in advance'], ['instructions', 'management', 'positive', 'follow']];445

An early ticket also means you can do the rest of the Alhambra at your leisure without worrying about getting back for your time slot. For the price, we paid 14 Euros per person, we spent the whole day at the Alhambra leaving at 1800, having lunch in the cafeteria adjacent to the hotel Parador restaurant. We made the waiters day as we had some local cuisine and can really recommend the food. It was excellent and made a good point to stop during the early afternoon to recharge the batteries.As for the Alhambra itself we can only add to the already excellent reviews by saying how wonderful it was. The Nasrid Palace was stunning and the monuments in the rest of the grounds were equally impressive. Given the 14 Euro entry fee for all this and spending the entire day there it is easy to see why this should be considered such great value for money.We did notice various groups and small parties doing guided tours and while we can't comment on the quality or value for money of these we opted for the audio guides, which were 6 Euros each.

65;To avoid disappointment regarding entry to the palace (as seems to be the case with some of the negative reviews) book well in advance and follow the instructions. We booked our tickets some weeks in advance, printed out the tickets as instructed, brought our ID and had no problems with entry. We arrived at the entry gate, asked a helper what to do and they kindly directed us to the palace, which is about 20-30 minutes walk from the main entrance. If you do things right it will work out alright!We recommend an early ticket, our ticket was for 10AM and we arrived at 0845 and spent some time leisurely walking to the palace entrance. An early ticket also means you can do the rest of the Alhambra at your leisure without worrying about getting back for your time slot. For the price, we paid 14 Euros per person, we spent the whole day at the Alhambra leaving at 1800, having lunch in the cafeteria adjacent to the hotel Parador restaurant. We made the waiters day as we had some local cuisine and can really recommend the food. It was excellent and made a good point to stop during the early afternoon to recharge the batteries.As for the Alhambra itself we can only add to the already excellent reviews by saying how wonderful it was. The Nasrid Palace was stunning and the monuments in the rest of the grounds were equally impressive.

71;"My girlfriend and I have been talking about visiting this place for ages and it was kind of the main reason for visiting Spain this time. We opted to take a guided tour as we had heard there wasn't much in the way of information provided in the palace (which is true).

71;"My girlfriend and I have been talking about visiting this place for ages and it was kind of the main reason for visiting Spain this time. We opted to take a guided tour as we had heard there wasn't much in the way of information provided in the palace (which is true). Our tour picked us up in one of the main city squares then took us by minibus up to the entrance for the palace and gardens which is up a fairly steep hill. Our group was split into Spanish (majority) and English (mix of non-Spanish speakers from aournd the world). This was fine and in fact I thought it was nice that many Spanish people also came to visit. The major downside to this we found was that our guide would often end up answering questions (that weren't then translated) that interupted the English commentary. I appreciate that it is very difficult to speak to tow different groups for around 3-4 hrs and avoid this; for me it did just feel a little like we were neglected at times (perhaps I'm being sensitive), I know it bothered some of the others in our group too.

79;We booked at our Sunset Beach Club where we were staying for a tour to Granada and Alhambra and unfortunately the tour company who organised this tour was the worst tour experience we have ever been on throughout all our years of booking tours when away on holiday.Let me begin with we were picked up at 07.15hrs outside our Hotel and continued to pick up passengers on route - we did not actually arrive at the Alhambra until after 11.00hrs and were originally told it would only take 1 1/2 hrs to get here. Really far too long a journey for one of my family due to health condition.The tour was booked for 12.30 which was a good tour but this did not finish till after 14.00hrs then the coach took us into Granada but we did not arrive there till after 14.00hrs and were told we needed to be back on the bus at 16.15hrs prompt.Our hopeless tour guide from bus took us on a 20-25 minute walk into Granada where she basically dumped us at this square recommended a restaurant (where herself and bus diver were fed and watered) and left us. We had hardly any time to choose a restaurant but once we had by the time you were served and then had lunch it was time to do the 20-25 minute walk back to the bus.We saw nothing of Granada itself and if we had known this would never have booked this tour. What a rip off as it was the most expensive out of all the tours we had booked. We had heard how lovely Granada was and we still have not seen it.There was also another family on the bus who like ourselves thought they would have time to have a nice lunch and had pre-booked at a particular restaurant in the area that was highly recommended they mentioned this to Jose the tour guide on our bus and she was rather abrupt with customers and said they would not have time to go there.I think when anyone booking this trip should be aware that you really are getting ripped off and that you are not going to have a good experience as the time it takes to get there and back does not permit substantial time in Alhambra and then visiting Granada such a shame as we had been looking forward to this so much and could have spent our money on two other trips instead.We had also booked another trip to Gibraltar but this was with a different tour company VDT who were super organised and trip to Gibraltar was fun and interesting.The guides on this trip compared to ones to Granada were wonderful and so efficient.;We booked at our Sunset Beach Club where we were staying for a tour to Granada and Alhambra and unfortunately the tour company who organised this tour was the worst tour experience we have ever been on throughout all our years of booking tours when away on holiday.;We booked at our Sunset Beach Club where we were staying for a tour to Granada and Alhambra and unfortunately the tour company who organised this tour was the worst tour experience we have ever been on throughout all our years of booking tours when away on holiday.####[['tour experience', 'attraction experience', 'negative', 'worst']];We booked at our Sunset Beach Club where we were staying for a tour to Granada and Alhambra and unfortunately the tour company who organised this tour was the worst tour experience we have ever been on throughout all our years of booking tours when away on holiday.####[['tour company', 'management', 'negative', 'worst tour experience']];We booked at our Sunset Beach Club where we were staying for a tour to Granada and Alhambra and unfortunately the tour company who organised this tour was the worst tour experience we have ever been on throughout all our years of booking tours when away on holiday.####[['tour company', 'management', 'negative', 'worst'], ['tour experience', 'attraction experience', 'negative', 'worst']];544

I'm sure it's charming in daylight but, although lit, it's extremely difficult to see anything here after dark. From what I could make out the gardens that are here now were laid out pretty recently and this seems to be the case. There's also an open-air theatre that dates from 1952! The palace itself features lace-like decoration on walls and ceilings, but again it would be better viewed by day. There was no access to an upper floor. From a terrace there was a tantalising view of the Alhambra proper across a gorge. We stayed 45 minutes and that was pushing it. But we won't be defeated.

121;I paid £60 for a day trip to the palace. I paid £6 for an audio tour. Our group of 8 split up to wander the palace and were meant to meet up again to go inside the palace together at 630pm. 10minutes after arriving I lost my ticket and all of my group. I tried to go back through the medina where I had walked to get back to the enterance and I was denied because I didn't have a ticket. I walked to the enterance to the inner palace and was told I needed to wait for my group. I sat and waited an hour for them to arrive as I couldn't get anywhere without a ticket. The guy on the queue could see our tickets clearly all said x of 8 on them, we were a group of 8 but with only 7 tickets. They scanned all the tickets in when my group arrived but still denied me entry and told me I couldn't re-buy a ticket as they'd all sold out. Another lady sent me back to a different office to try and get a new ticket but I was told I only had 10minutes till last entry. I went to the office, they told me they needed to physically see all the other tickets before they would issue me a ticket (despite their computer scanning ticket system which had already obviously logged 7 of the 8 tickets. I offered to whatsapp a photo of all the tickets but my group had already dispersed inside and weren't willing to all come back just to get me in. I had paid for a ticket, I had paid for an audio tour I had a photo of one of the tickets so they could find the booking but still they wouldn't reprint a ticket.

They scanned all the tickets in when my group arrived but still denied me entry and told me I couldn't re-buy a ticket as they'd all sold out. Another lady sent me back to a different office to try and get a new ticket but I was told I only had 10minutes till last entry. I went to the office, they told me they needed to physically see all the other tickets before they would issue me a ticket (despite their computer scanning ticket system which had already obviously logged 7 of the 8 tickets. I offered to whatsapp a photo of all the tickets but my group had already dispersed inside and weren't willing to all come back just to get me in.

First they make you pay a fee for general admission and then it turns out you can't see half the things, which are probably the most interesting. Second you lie there walking around and visiting things and there are hardly any toilets, water vending machines at least, fountains... there are some but one every... lots. Our perception is that it is more like people paint it to or that it really is. The generalife is basically a walk in gardens to see an old house that can only be seen outside (there are much prettier gardens like those of the Farm of San Ildefonso). The only good thing there is the views you see from a kind of viewpoint. Charles V Palace are rooms with exhibitions of paintings, ceramics and little else, I have visited many palacesin which you can see great halls,furniture, rooms, costumes etc and the Nasrid Palaces well if you have been like us in the Mosque of Cordoba because it falls far behind this. And the wall of the Alhambra in general as normal , for example the one of Ávila is more beautiful and impresses more.

135;Having been to the Alcazar in Seville a few years ago - I had great expectations for the Alhambra.  However - it did not meet them.  It's a grand complex of old structures with fantastic views across Granada - but it seemed a bit 'sterile' and under-maintained, and certainly not the opulent palatial residence I expected.  It's certainly worth a visit, don't get that wrong, but it's not the spectacular venue I hoped for.  Also - make sure you book in advance.  Apparently tickets sell out - but you can probably find alternative tours online if you can't self-guide.

Well there is really no direction on where to go when u get there. We followed the crowd and found the Alhambra fort. Our ticket got scanned again and we visited this for about 30 minutes. The views are amazing (it gets the one star I’m willing to give). We then saw a massive line for one of the palaces and got in this line. By the time we reached the ticket scanner we were told our tickets were no longer valid and we couldn’t go in. None of this is explained at any time. We thought the time booked was for entrance into the entire complex. We could have easily seen the fort after the palace if we’d known. And there were a stack of people in the line for the 7pm time and they weren’t letting them in because it was too early, yet no signs/people telling us to move up because our ticket was much earlier.Very disappointed.
